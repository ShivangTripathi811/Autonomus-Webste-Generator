## Concise Summary Of Code

1. Firstly, We are taking raw input from the user.

1. After, this we are giving this raw prompt to an AI agent created from agent.ai which enhances the input.

1. After enhancing the input we give that prompt to another AI agent along with some XML template.

1. The AI agent returns the website code in XML format in a single file.

1. After getting XML file we use a npm library to parse it into json format. From JSON we convert it into a tree. And, give the tree to BackEnd.

1. The BackEnd creates the given folder structure and puts the appropriate code in it.

1. After creating folder structure, we have preview, deploy button.

1. The preview button checks for an empty localhost and creates a docker container and allows the user to preview it.

1. The deploy button uses the Github API and creates a repository. We host it using github pages.

1. Download as a zip, this button just simply allows the user to download generated code in a Zip file.
